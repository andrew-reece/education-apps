<h2>Education applications</h2>

<u><b>Background</b></u>
<br />
Applications to improve student-faculty workflow and administrative
efficiency in the Harvard University course system.  
<br /><br />
<b><u>Projects</u></b>
<ul>
<li>
	<a href="https://github.com/dharmahound/datascience/tree/master/barbaric-yelp">Problem Set Helper</a>
	- This app lets students text or email their availability to a central server, which uses
Google Apps suite to keep track of dates/times/psets.  Whenever the app detects a matching 
study time between 2+ students, it sends all parties an email notifying them that there's someone
else who wants to work on the same pset at the same time as them.  That way students can find
each other to work together.
