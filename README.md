efficiency.  
<br /><br />
<b><u>Projects</u></b>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/dharmahound/education-apps/tree/master/pset-helper">Problem Set Helper</a>
		- This app lets students text or email their availability to a central server, which uses
	Google Apps suite to keep track of dates/times/psets.  Whenever the app detects a matching 
	study time between 2+ students, it sends all parties an email notifying them that there's someone
	else who wants to work on the same pset at the same time as them.  That way students can find
	each other to work together.
	</li>

	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/dharmahound/education-apps/tree/master/tf-seminar-helper">TF Seminar Helper</a>
		- In a graduate seminar, the majority of tasks required of teaching assistants requires repetitive, mundane tasks that should be automated (eg. emailing,
	entering grades in spreadsheets, etc).  So I automated them, with the help of Google Apps Suite scripting.
