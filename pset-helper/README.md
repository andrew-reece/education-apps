<h2>Problem Set App for Harvard undergraduates (2014)</h2>
Git repository for the Pset Helper App I created for undergrads in big intro classes (2014).

<b>Background</b>
<br />
Many intro math/science classes have 3 problem sets due every week.  It's a crushing amount of work, and it's often
hard to find classmates who are working on the same pset...and they're hard to do alone.
<br />
NB: Main code file is 'pset-helper.json' - it's actually a googlescript file on gdrive, but downloading turns it into json.
<br />
(So it's not very readable if you simply open it up to have a look.)
<br /> <br />
This app lets students text or email their availability to a central server, which uses
Google Apps suite to keep track of dates/times/psets.  Whenever the app detects a matching 
study time between 2+ students, it sends all parties an email notifying them that there's someone
else who wants to work on the same pset at the same time as them.  That way students can find
each other to work together.  As it is, there's an enormous resource set (ie. other students) that
often goes wasted...it's just too hard to find who else is working when you are.  
<br />
Hopefully we'll beta test this semester in intro math classes on campus.
