to-do (in order of priority):

##

the main thing to work on when you get back is sorting out the 30 min before/after feature
there are a few things going wrong right now:

first, 
consider that exact matches may also be 30 min before/after other time requests.
in this case, the exact matchers should only get exact match emails, and not early/late emails
right now, they get them all

second, 
i'm not sure there's a way to do this with the current setup, but it would really be
best if you run the exact match emails first, and keep track of who gets sent mail
then, run the before/after emails, but exclude all email addresses that already got exact mail
you may want to assign unique IDs in the spreadsheet rows along with email addresses, just in
case one person enters multiple times (in fact, you need to do this unless you erase rows after
they've gotten an email, which isn't as good an idea)

third,
users can, in theory, receive both before and after emails, as long as they don't have an exact
match.  so once the exact emails go out, non-exact-matched users can receive up to two emails.
you don't really need to keep track of whether they've gotten a before/after, because there
shouldn't be a condition under which they'd receive more than one before (or after) email.

fourth, 
if possible, include a link (or at least instructions to reply-to) in early/late emails
so that students, if they see a nearby time they can make, can make a new entry in the 
spreadsheet and be matched.  they probably can't activate the script directly, so we'll have
to make it an email that gets scanned just like all the other ones.  (alternately they can use 
the web form...maybe that's what we give them a link to.)




##
- check 30 min before and after requested time, and make a suggestion to people 
if there's not an exact match for their desired time, but there's one nearby.

	give them a link to click if they agree to shift back or forth 30 min, which automatically enters
	a new row in the spreadsheet and links them up
	if so, delete the initial row they'd been registered under
##
- figure out how to send full messages to SMS people
##
- also, send SMS email addresses and phone numbers, since no 'cc:'
- or, ask SMSers to provide email address
- or, when letting them know there's a match, ask for their email and then coordinate that way
##
- have the check function run on every new row addition
##
- have email function run every 15 min
##
- include an option to just enter 'morning/afternoon/evening/late[night]'
- morning constitutes anytime 7a - 12p
- afternoon: 12p - 5pm
- evening: 5p - 11p
- latenight: 11p - 4a
##
- if 'now' written for time, look up to an hour forward for matches

DONE
 integrate with spreadsheet of available rooms in different buildings, report avail. rooms in email
- send text or email to email address
- time: 545 pm, 545pm, 5:45[ ]pm, 17:00
- date/day: wed, wednesday
- check timestamp of previous entry, only look at emails from that point on
##
- rounding minutes to nearest 30?
##
- if today or tomorrow is included, then ignore date and just compute today/tomorrow from Date()
##
- if only 'wed' or 'wednesday', find that day of the week within the next week, and use that
