I can communicate an idea in many different ways
*I avoid new and unusual situations
*I feel like I never get to make decisions
In any given situation, I am able to act appropriately
I can find workable solutions to seemingly unsolvable problems
*I seldom have choices to choose from when deciding how to behave
I am willing to work at creative solutions to problems
My behavior is a result of conscious decisions that I make
I have many possible ways of behaving in any given situation
*I have difficulty using my knowledge on a given topic in real life situations
I am willing to listen and consider alternatives for handling a problem
I have the self-confidence necessary to try different ways of behavior
