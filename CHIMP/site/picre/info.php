As mentioned in the introduction, creativity researchers try to find decent ways of measuring creativity. Some of them investigate thinking style, others personality, others again look at product. With the present test, we make an attempt to unify different aspects of testing creativity. Thus we seek to include cognition, personality, environment, and process to gain a broad way of describing and testing creativity.
