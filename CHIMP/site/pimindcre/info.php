With this broad study, we make an attempt to investigate creativity from different perspectives, such as personality, cognition, environment. Only recently some researchers developed an objective measurement approach towards functional creativity (i.e., creativity manifested in products, e.g. Cropley, 2005; Cropley & Cropley, 2008; Haller, Courvoisier & Cropley, 2009b), rather than using divergent thinking tests as synonymous with creativity. Since we agree with those researchers to not only use divergent thinking tests as a measurement of creativity, we ask you to create products, which will be evaluated by experts. Creativity has been connected to mental, and physical health. Actually, creativity can consistently contribute to positive health (for an overview see e.g., Runco, 2007). Therefore we try to find a way to enhance creativity to consistently contribute to have more creative people everywhere. Taking part in the present study will help you find out more about yourself, your creativity, the enhancement of your creativity, and will make you a part of a study which has the potential to find a way to make people of various background more creative, more mindful, and thus, more healthy.
