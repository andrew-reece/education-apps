	* clean up register code on update_records.php
	
	* more interaction with AJAX box on ADMIN HOME?
		-- for UPLOAD, possible to AJAX files with GET?  if so, you could display "students have been uploaded successfully.  to see the list of names uploaded, click here"
		
	* validation for uploaded data
	
	* eventually on EDIT page, have tabs for GENERAL, ATTENDANCE, ADMIN COMMENTS?  javascript switch DIV for HTML

write partial match capability on search name page
check july 2008 stuff

put in "last updated" on View (and Edit?) and search results

add "possible name match" to search single record, if you don't know how to spell full name, partial then click button and brings match window underneath everything

set validation with course month vs sash level (not yet, wait for word)
		
	* SECURITY NOTE FOR MICHAEL: cookie is set with access level in plain text.  for "remember me" logons, user could feasibly go into cookie file, change access level number, save cookie, and then have higher access?
	
	* ALSO SECURITY: check if agama site PHP has magic quotes turned on, even so, should escape form input better
	
	* BASIC ACCESS: 1
	* ADMIN ACCESS: 4

	* register_student.php javascript doesn't work in IE
