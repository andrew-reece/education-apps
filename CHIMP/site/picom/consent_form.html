<h3>Informed Consent Form </h3>

Please consider this information carefully before deciding whether to participate in this research.
<br /><br />
<b>Purpose of the research:</b> To validate a questionnaire on personal characteristics.
<br /><br />
<b>What you will do in this research:</b> You will complete two questionnaires on demographic variables, handedness, musical background, and personal characteristics.
<br /><br />
<b>Time required:</b> Participation in the entire study will take approximately ten minutes to complete.  
<br /><br />
<b>Risks:</b> There are no anticipated risks associated with participating in this study. 
<br /><br />
<b>Benefits:</b> At the end of the study, we will provide a thorough explanation of the study and of our hypotheses.  We will describe the potential implications of the results of the study both if our hypotheses are supported and if they are disconfirmed.  If you wish, you can send an email message to Dr. Chiara Haller (haller@wjh.harvard.edu) and we will send you summaries of the overall study results.
<br /><br />

<b>Confidentiality:</b> Your participation in this study will remain confidential, and your identity will not be stored with your data.  Your responses will be assigned a random numerical code number, which will be the only identifying mark on all of the data-gathering items in this study.  There will be no “key” or master-list linking participants’ name to their number or to any of the data-gathering materials. All data-gathering items will be stored in a locked file cabinet.  In keeping with the American Psychological Association's ethics committee rules and procedures, all data-gathering items will be securely destroyed five years after the end of the study. Test-retest reliability?? External validity? Creativity?
<br /><br />
<b>Participation and withdrawal:</b> Your participation in this study is completely voluntary, and you may withdraw at any time without penalty (i.e., you will still receive pro-rated study pool credit.)  You may withdraw by informing the researcher that you no longer wish to participate (no questions will be asked).
<br /><br />
