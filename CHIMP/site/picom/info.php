Personality is one important aspect of creativity is personality. Researchers tried to find unifying characteristics of the creative personality for a long time, and found the creative person to be a complex person (Csikszentmihalyi, 1996). Researchers found openness to be important, others again conscientiousness, some found more agreeable people to be more creative, others again, less agreeable people. With the present scale we aim to find unifying characteristics of creative people.
